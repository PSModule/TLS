# TLS

A PowerShell module that helps manage and configure TLS settings on your system.

## Prerequisites

This uses the following external resources:
- The [PSModule framework](https://github.com/PSModule) for building, testing and publishing the module.

## Installation

To install the module from the PowerShell Gallery, you can use the following command:

```powershell
Install-PSResource -Name TLS
Import-Module -Name TLS
```

## Usage

Below are some typical use cases for the module's functions:

### Example 1: Retrieve the Current TLS Configuration

```powershell
Get-TLSConfig
```

- Returns the TLS protocol(s) currently enabled for .NET applications on the system.

### Example 2: List All Available TLS Protocols

```powershell
Get-TLSConfig -ListAvailable
```

- Displays all TLS protocol types that can be potentially enabled.

### Example 3: Enable TLS 1.2

```powershell
Set-TLSConfig -Protocol Tls12
```

- Enables TLS 1.2 on the system without disabling previously enabled protocols.

### Example 4: Enable Multiple TLS Protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3)

```powershell
Set-TLSConfig -Protocol Tls12, Tls13
```

- Simultaneously enables TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.
